# Dino Rerun

A remake or "rerun" of the Chrome dino run game built with p5js a JavaScript library used to create interactive visuals in a web browser. Because this library is geared towards graphics and animations, building a simple game like this involved more boilerplate code such as collision handling and physics. All pixel art was drawn with a tool called [Pixilart](https://pixelart.com/). The pixel/game style font used is called [Press Start 2P](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Press+Start+2P).
